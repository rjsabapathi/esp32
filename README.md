It includes necessary libraries: WiFi.h, Firebase_ESP_Client.h, TokenHelper.h, RTDBHelper.h, and LiquidCrystal_I2C.h. These libraries provide the functionality for Wi-Fi connection, Firebase integration, token management, and LCD display.

Constants and variables are defined. This includes Wi-Fi credentials (WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD), Firebase API key (API_KEY), database URL (DATABASE_URL), pin assignments, LCD settings, and other variables for tracking states and values.

The setup() function is called once during the startup of the microcontroller. It initializes the LCD, establishes a Wi-Fi connection, sets up Firebase configuration, and performs Firebase sign-up/authentication.

The loop() function runs continuously after the setup() function. It performs the following tasks:

a. Checks if the Wi-Fi connection is lost. If disconnected, it turns off the LED, updates the Wi-Fi status and LED status in Firebase, and returns.

b. If Wi-Fi is still connected, it continues with the following operations.

c. Sends data to Firebase every 5 seconds (if conditions are met). It generates random data for the light-dependent resistor (LDR) and calculates the voltage based on the LDR value. It then updates these values in the Firebase Realtime Database.

d. Reads the "analog" value from the Firebase Realtime Database. If successful, it checks the data type, converts the received string value to an integer, and sets the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) value accordingly. It also updates the LED status based on the PWM value.

e. If the LED status is active, it sets the PWM value to control the LED intensity.

The code seems to be designed to monitor LDR values and control an LED using PWM based on data stored in the Firebase Realtime Database. Additionally, it includes LCD functionality to display status messages
